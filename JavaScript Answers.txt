1.What is your favourite new javascript feature and why?
Ans : Conditional Rendering is my favourite javascript feature.
   It helps developer to show meanigfull output or we can say show different components if there is different conditions.

2.Explain an interesting way in which you have used this javascript feature.
Ans :
                    {!isLoading &&
                    (rows.length > 0 ? (
                        <tbody {...getTableBodyProps()}>
                            {rows.map((row, i) => {
                                prepareRow(row);
                                return (
                                    <tr {...row.getRowProps()}>
                                        {row.cells.map((cell) => {
                                            return (
                                                <td {...cell.getCellProps()}>{cell.render("Cell")}</td>
                                            );
                                        })}
                                    </tr>
                                );
                            })}
                        </tbody>
                    ) : (
                        "No Record Found."
                    ))}

In above example , rows will be created only if there is data loaded otherwise we can show loader untill we have data.
After completing loading process if there is no data  it will provide message " No records Found".

3.Is there any difference between regular function syntax and the shorter arrow function syntax? (Write the answer in your own words)
Ans :
 -Regular function:
  It is necessary to use function keyword
  Need to write return statement.
-Arrow function:
  No need to use function keyword, we can declared like const or variable.
  If there is single line function no need to write return statement.

       Example of arrow functions:-
       const square=(x)=>x*x

       Example of regular functions:-
       let s = function sqaure(x){
        return (x*x);
       };

4.What is the difference between ‘myFunctionCall(++foo)’   and  ‘myFunctionCall(foo++)’
Ans :
    First of all we can not pass operators in function arguments , but if we look it as logical question
    1.myFunctionCall(++foo) : It will increment foo argument value by 1 before we use it inside function as it is pre-increment operator.
    2..myFunctionCall(foo++) : It will not increment foo argument before use as it is post increment operator.

5.In your own words, explain what a javascript ‘class’ is and how it differs from a function.
Ans :
   Javascript class :  It is mechanism of grouping functions together and then we can use class instance to call functions of the class.
    To create javascript class there is certain steps:
1.class declaration
2.class expression
3.class body and function defination
 
   where "functions" are independent entity.
   we can create functions and call it , if function is independant it does not require instance of class but if function is define inside a class then it needs class instace to call.
